# This file has been placed in /root because a SAP application 
# was installed in compatibility mode. In order to remove the
# compatibility mode, the following steps need to be performed:


Step 1:

Update your SAP application as stated in "SAP Note 1310037 - SUSE 
LINUX Enterprise Server 11: Installation notes".



Step 2:

Check if the compatibility mode is still active:

In compatibility mode you will find a file called "uname26.conf"
in the directory /etc/security.
And the file  "/etc/init.d/sapinit" contains the following line:
"#!/usr/bin/uname26 /bin/sh" at the start of that file.



Step 3:

In order to remove the compatibility mode the following actions
need to be performed:


- create a directory /root/SAP-compat-tmp

- move the file /etc/security/uname26.conf to the directory /root/SAP-compat-tmp

- copy the file /etc/init.d/sapinit to the directory /root/SAP-compat-tmp

- edit the file /etc/init.d/sapinit and exchange the line:
"#!/usr/bin/uname26 /bin/sh" with "#!/bin/sh"

- reboot the system

- after reboot make sure the system operates as expected!
(if that's not the case, then move back the file sapinit to /etc/init.d/ and 
the file uname26.conf to etc/security/ and reboot. 
After reboot please check again if the update of the SAP application has been
performed successfully)

- if the system operates as expected it is safe to remove the directory 
/root/SAP-compat-tmp and its content.
The compatibility mode has been removed successfully.
